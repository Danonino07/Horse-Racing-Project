# Horse-Racing-Project

I preprocess the data for various horse races (cleaning, feature engineering, etc) after exploring it. I then discuss model options (specifically the mathematics behind mixed-effects models as a tool to avoid the independence of samples assumption) and eventually make a predictive model (XGBoost) by using time-aware cross-validation. Afterwards, I examine possible strategies by comparing my model against the market, performing a hypothesis test.
